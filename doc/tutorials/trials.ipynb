The `Trials` classes provide a unified API to access and manipulate trial data, regardless of whether the data is stored in `neo.Block` or as lists of lists."

    "In neuroscience, trials are repeated experimental runs that help in estimating various quantities from the data. The Trials class in Elephant provides a structured way to handle and access trial data, irrespective of how it is stored. This overview will cover the basic structure and functionalities of the Trials class and its subclasses."
